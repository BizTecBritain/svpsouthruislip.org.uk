The SVP Team hope that you all had a lovely Easter weekend and wish you a very Holy Easter Season. As a team, we are continually blessed and energised by the amazing examples of true Christian witnessing that we see around us! Your support, through your prayers, your volunteering, your messages and your donations, is really tangible and real and it is very much appreciated. Each Saturday, your support allows us to not only continue to operate the [Foodbank](../../pages-output/foodbank/) but to also do some home deliveries to our sisters and brothers who are in real need.

We are not sure if we have covered all the housebound in need, so please [let us know](../../pages-output/contact/) if you know of someone who is missing out. We will always do our best to make sure that everyone is covered.

God Bless!
