There are a few changes in the coming weeks that I would like to make you aware of: The Family Quiz night scheduled for July 9 unfortunately has had to be postponed. We will keep you posted with a new date as soon as it is confirmed.

Bereavement Care Group will meet this month on Wednesday, July 13, instead of July 6. Please join Bridget and the team for a cuppa and a chat. I will remind you nearer the time.

As always the SVP continues to be here for the parish and our community. If you or anyone you know would like a visit from an SVP member please [get in touch](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
