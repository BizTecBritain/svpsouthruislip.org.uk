The SVP's watchwords *"Be Aware"* have rarely been more appropriate. Can you please keep an extra eye and ear out for your neighbours during this challenging time. And, if they are struggling for some foodstuffs, or would just like a chat over the phone, then let us know.

Your SVP Team has been boosted by some wonderful parishioners who are on standby to do shopping/delivering for the needy and the [Foodbank](../../pages-output/foodbank/) is still operating (with a [de minimus team](../../posts-output/2020-03-21-foodbank-changes/)) and receiving some very generous donations from our local shops.

With everyone's help we will weather this storm and reach the calm waters again. Remember, the SVP Team can be [contacted](../../pages-output/contact/) via phone and email.

God Bless!
