We're fond of saying that the most valuable thing we distribute at our weekly food bank is a cup of tea. It is served by a friendly face, someone you can sit down with and talk to. That fills your heart, not just your belly.

When people find themselves in need of a food bank, they feel isolated and alone, and they approach our door for the first time with trepidation. Walking into our food bank on a Saturday afternoon is usually a bit of a shock -- it's filled with people, all supporting each other. You can't really tell the volunteers from the clients, and we like it that way. And most of our clients come to collect their food, but stay for the full two hours for the companionship.

Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic means we need to suspend that most valuable of gifts that we can offer. We will still offer a friendly face, and the food you need, but we won't be able to sit down and share a tea or coffee and a biscuit. I find this heartbreaking, since it is one of the most joyful parts of my week.

But we don't want to make our clients sick, or put our volunteers (many of whom are older) in danger, so for the foreseeable future, the hall will be empty (except for a few chairs) and there will be fewer volunteers. We're asking our clients to collect their food and move on. The church next door is still open, so please feel free to stop in for a quiet moment or two of prayer before you go.

We hope these measure will be temporary and we will get back to our happy, homey place in the near future.
