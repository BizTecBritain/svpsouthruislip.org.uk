Challenges bring opportunity and, so, on Monday evening we held our first ever online monthly meeting! It proved to be very effective, with almost half the team attending, and we will now work on increasing our attendance for the next one! Our workstreams have adapted wonderfully to the current situation. Specifically, we are:

 * Operating the [Foodbank](../../pages-output/foodbank/).
 * Providing a shopping and delivery service for the isolated among us.
 * Phone-buddying with those we used to [visit at home](../../pages-output/home-visits/).
 * Phone-buddying with our bothers in the [immigration detention centres](../../pages-output/refugee/).

We are also planning to send some children (boys 8-13yrs, girls 9-12yrs) on the [St John Bosco summer camps](https://www.svp.org.uk/microsite/st-john-bosco-childrens-camp), currently planned for late July and August. Please get in touch if you know of a child who could benefit from a week of fun!

Finally, please 'Be Aware' and, remember, the SVP Team can be [contacted](../../pages-output/contact/) via phone and email.

God Bless!
