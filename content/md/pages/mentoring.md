Our group has spawned a couple of related groups of young people. We do events with our local [Mini Vinnies](https://www.svp.org.uk/mini-vinnies), such as cake sales, to raise money or provide activities for our older parishioners and neighbours, such as those in care homes.

We also have our own associated [B-Attitude](https://www.svp.org.uk/svp-b-attitude) group. The members are older teenagers (14-18) enthusiastic about getting involved in our community. Many of these help us out every week at the food bank, for example.

If you are interested in joining, please [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/).
