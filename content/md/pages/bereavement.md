Nothing makes you feel so alone and empty as losing a close loved one. Talking with someone, especially someone who has gone through it, can help you carry that burden.

Our group meets once a month, on the first Wednesday, in the Parish hall. We may have to do this in a virtual way during the pandemic. We will provide more information on this before our next meeting.
