Since the SVP was founded in 1833, a special focus has been person-to-person care, especially with those isolated in the community. We share our time with the long-term sick (or their carers), elderly people with few friends or family nearby, the recently widowed and others who, for many reasons, feel alone.

We hear of people to visit from our parish and neighbours. If you know of someone who you feel might benefit from a friendly chat once a week, please [let us know](../../pages-output/contact/).

If you feel called to help in this work, we welcome new volunteers. As we visit people in their homes, we have strict safeguarding policies and procedures and all visiting members must hold a DBS certificate. We can arrange that if you decide to join us.
