The Saint Vincent de Paul Society Conference at Saint Gregory the Great Parish in South Ruislip is a small community of people who aim to help others in practical ways. Our focus is hands-on, person-to-person care -- a friendly chat over a warm cup of tea. We are  inspired by Christ's message: to love our neighbour as ourselves, to feed the hungry and befriend the lonely. Our neighbour is anyone in need in the local community, without regard to faith, ethnicity, status or sexual orientation.

Our group is part of the [SVP Society of England and Wales](https://www.svp.org.uk/). As with all SVP groups, visiting the lonely, sick, grieving or housebound is focus of our work. We rely on the community to let us know of people who need our help, so please don't hesitate to contact us if you know someone who could use a hand.

We also run a distribution centre for the [Hillingdon Foodbank](https://hillingdown.foodbank.org.uk/) each Saturday from noon to 2.

Our membership is also open to anyone, of any background. The main requirement is a desire to help. As we visit people in their homes we have strict safeguarding policies and procedures and all visiting members must hold a DBS certificate. We can arrange that if you decide to join us.
