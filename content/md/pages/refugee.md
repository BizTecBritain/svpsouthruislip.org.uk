Our location in West London means that we're close to Europe's largest immigration removal centre, near Heathrow airport. Thousands of asylum seekers and refugees are detained here in crowded, prison-like conditions while they appeal in the courts for a chance at freedom and safety in Britain. Many of these (mostly) young men are alone and have no one visiting them during their detention, which can last months or even years.

Several of our volunteers have joined with another charity, the [Jesuit Refuge Service](https://www.jrsuk.net/), to visit these people. We spend an hour so, usually about once a week, just chatting with them, giving them the opportunity to just talk with a friendly person. This style of support, walking humbly alongside forced migrants as they go through unbelievable suffering and despair, can be hard, but it is an essential way of caring for the least among us.
