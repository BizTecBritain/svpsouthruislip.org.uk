One of the ways we try to give back to the local parish is to lead or support prayer services. We aim to do these at least twice a year. In past years, we've led the Stations of the Cross services.

We've been considering what to do this year, so we're always open to suggestions. Please [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/) and let us know what kind of prayer services you are interested in.
